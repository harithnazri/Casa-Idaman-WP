 üí° This is Our Web Programming Project üí°

Project title : Online Community System üñç 

Description :

This system is intended to engage the residents in a neighbourhood (e.g. apartment condominium) and provide a way for residents to keep in touch with each other.

üìàThe system should provide the following functions:
          Residents:
              ‚Ä¢ User login to access the system, manage the sessions
              ‚Ä¢ Manage user profile (view, update user details, delete a user account)
              ‚Ä¢ View nearby facilities ‚Äì can locate nearby facilities and shops, view
              the details
              ‚Ä¢ Register visitor coming to the resident‚Äôs house and the system can
              generate a visitor pass.
              ‚Ä¢ Report Covid-19 quarantine status to management office, residents also
              can view the number of active cases on daily basis and weekly basis
          Administrator from Management office:
              ‚Ä¢ Manage residents account (register new residents in the community, can
              view the list of residents, update neighbour information, and delete an
              account).
              ‚Ä¢ Manage the Covid-19 reporting ‚Äì validate, update and delete the
              information.
Phase 1: Week 3 to Week 8 (15%)

    Phase 1 focuses on front-end Web development. You need to develop a prototype which
    contains the user interface design of the Web application. The following client-side Web
    technologies must be used to develop the front-end of your system:
        ‚Ä¢ HTML5
        ‚Ä¢ CSS
        ‚Ä¢ JavaScript
        ‚Ä¢ Front-end Design templates (e.g. Bootstrap)
    Additional technologies are allowed.
Phase 2: Week 9 to Week 14 (25%)

    Complete all the system development, including both client-side (front-end) and server-side (backend) development in this phase. Apart from the 
    client-side technologies, the Web application must
    also use a server-side scripting and a database. A technical report and a user manual of the system
    need to be prepared and submitted upon completion of the project. Each team is required to
    present the completed system.
